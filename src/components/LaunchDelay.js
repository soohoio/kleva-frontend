          Hello KLEVARs, <br /><br />
          KLEVA Team has announced earlier that KLEVA Protocol is to launch today at 18:00 SGT.<br />
          In actuality, Launch is based on block number, and may differ from actual time. <br /><br />
          Klaytn mainnet has experienced a short delay in block generation in the past two days,<br />
          and thus block number has also been delayed, respectively. <br /><br />
          Due to the delay, we regret to announce that the launch of KLEVA Protocol will have to be postponed by approximately 20 minutes.<br />
          KLEVA Team appreciates all KLEVARsâ€™ kind understanding for this deferment. <br /><br />
          Additionally, KLEVA Protocol Launch Count Down on https://kleva.io has been altered to be based on block number.<br />
          Please refer to the block number countdown for actual KLEVA Protocol Launch. <br /><br />
          Sincerely yours,<br />
          KLEVA Team
        </p>
