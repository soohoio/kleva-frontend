  "glossary.defiGeneral": `DeFi General`,
  "glossary.1.title": `Token Approval`,
  "glossary.1.description": `Every token requires one-time token approval prior to the first use on the protocol. The purpose is to give protocol access to user's wallet in order to validate the wallet balance and transfer tokens that user's want to make transaction of. In the process of token approval, small amount of KLAY is needed as a gas fee.`,
  "glossary.2.title": `Token Swap`,
  "glossary.2.description": `Token swap refers to transaction in which token is exchanged for a different token. With the swap service, user may exchange the tokens in one's wallet for the token one needs. `,
  "glossary.3.title": `APR / APY`,
  "glossary.3.description": `1) APR <br/>APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate and it refers to the interest user will receive for providing asset<br/><br/>2) APY <br/>APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield and it refers to the compounding interest user will receive for providing asset. Compounding means that the interest earned is reinvested and contributed to the next calculated interest rate. `,
  "glossary.4.title": `Price impact`,
  "glossary.4.description": `Price impact occurs when the ratio of asset is shifted due to a large size asset swap. As a result, user experience loss ,receiving less asset than expected with the discrepancy between current market price and the price user actually pays<br/><br/>When doing leverage yield farming on KLEVA protocol two types of token need to be deposited at same value ratio of 50:50. If not, token swap occurs to make them equal in value. KLEVA protocol uses token with higher value to swap to the lower one. In this process there may be price impact. `,
  "glossary.5.title": `Slippage`,
  "glossary.5.description": `Slippage refers to the difference between the expected token price and the actual executed price. The difference comes from the shift in token exchange ratio just before the transaction is submitted. This might affect the number of tokens actually acquired by the user. <br/><br/>In order to prevent loss coming from slippage, user may set slippage allowance percentage. For instance with the slippage allowance of 0.5%, if the actual number of token received varies more than 0.5% to the expected number, the transaction will be reverted. `,
  "glossary.6.title": `Protocol`,
  "glossary.6.description": `Protocol is a set of rules that allows the transfer of data and communication between two or more computers. So on blockchain protocol cryptocurrencies maybe transferred and exchanged securely.`,
  "glossary.7.title": `Decentralized Exchange`,
  "glossary.7.description": `DEX stands for Decentralized Exchange where peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading occurs without intermediary thanks to smart contract. Originally, in centralized exchanges (CEX) transaction was done between individual and server-- which acts as a intermediary. Unlike CEX, in DEXs transaction is proceeded automatically without intermediary when each individual's conditions are met. `,
  "glossary.8.title": `Governance token `,
  "glossary.8.description": `Governance token is minted to incentivize users to actively participate for the protocols' future growth making the protocol self-sustainable. By using the governance token, user may make a proposal for the protocol's future and exercise the vote. In the case of KLEVA protocol, there is a governance token named KLEVA. `,
  "glossary.9.title": `Buyback & burn `,
  "glossary.9.description": `Buyback & Burn is a policy KLEVA protocol has to maintain the value of KLEVA token. Buyback is where KLEVA protocol buys some KLEVA token circulating in the market with the fee the protocol has collected. Then KLEVA protocol burns the KLEVA token in order to decrease the number of KLEVA tokens circulating in the market. Total amount of KLEVA token burned can be seen in DOCs Tokenomics > Proof-of-Burn(PoB)`,
  "glossary.lend": `Lend · Stake`,
  "glossary.10.title": `Lend`,
  "glossary.10.description": `Lend is a main service of the KLEVA protocol where users may earn interest by depositing tokens. Deposited tokens are utilized by the farmers. Farmers are able to open a bigger position with borrowed tokens. They will have to pay borrowing interest but will be able to earn higher APY. The borrowing interest farmers pay becomes interest for the token deposited. `,
  "glossary.11.title": `Stake`,
  "glossary.11.description": `Staking is a process of locking up tokens user is holding to the protocol and earn reward. In KLEVA protocol users can stake ib tokens that they received for the depositing token to KLEVA protocol and earn KLEVA token.`,
  "glossary.12.title": `Utilization Ratio (UR)`,
  "glossary.12.description": `Utilization Ratio (UR) indicates how much the deposited tokens are used in lending farmers. Increase in lending will lead to higher UR and higher borrowing interest, resulting in higher deposit profit.Borrowing interest is affected by UR. More information about this can be found in Docs > Triple Slope Model. `,
  "glossary.13.title": `ibToken`,
  "glossary.13.description": `ib Token stands for interest bearing token that accumulates interest by just holding it. <br/><br/>When user deposit token to KLEVA protocol, they are given ib token as a proof of deposit. The amount user receives depends on the conversion ratio. For example, with the conversion ratio of 1 ibWEMIX = 1 WEMIX, user will receive 100 ibWEMIX for depositing 100 WEMIX. The token deposited is lended to farmers<br/><br/>Farms in return pay borrowing interest, which is used to increase the ib token conversion ratio. So carrying on with the example, the conversion ratio will rise to 1 ibWEMIX - 1.001WEMIX, increasing the value of ib token.<br/><br/>As a result when user decides to make a withdrawal, depositors will be given more token then they first deposited. In addition those who staked ib tokens will be able to earn KLEVA token reward. `,
  "glossary.farming": `Farm`,
  "glossary.14.title": `Farm`,
  "glossary.14.description": `Farm is a service where users are distributed transaction fee as a reward for depositing a pair of tokens in a DEX. The source of the reward is the governance token of the DEX. KLEVA protocol rewards farmers with additional KLEVA token for taking part in leverage yield farming. `,
  "glossary.15.title": `Leverage`,
  "glossary.15.description": `Leverage yield farming is a function to use when user want to open a position bigger than their current balance. User can increase total asset in position and seek higher APY by borrowing token through leverage. `,
  "glossary.16.title": `Borrowing Interest`,
  "glossary.16.description": `Borrowing interest is interest farmers pay to lenders for borrowing the token.`,
  "glossary.17.title": `Position Value`,
  "glossary.17.description": `Position value explains the status of the farm position. Current USD value and the amount of tokens in the position is displayed. <br/><br/>* Position value = equity value + debt value`,
  "glossary.18.title": `Equity Value`,
  "glossary.18.description": `Equity value is the asset that was originally owned by the user prior to doing leverage yield farming. Thus user may be able to find the amount of token user put to the position and the interest profit it has produced so far. `,
  "glossary.19.title": `Debt Value`,
  "glossary.19.description": `Debt value refers to the amount of asset user has borrowed and the amount of borrowing interest generated. `,
  "glossary.20.title": `Debt Ratio`,
  "glossary.20.description": `Debt ratio is a ratio of debt value to position value. If debt ratio gets to high, borrowed asset is thought to be at risk. Thus to protect the asset the position may get automatically closed and be liquidated.<br/><br/>* Debt ratio = debt value / total asset`,
  "glossary.21.title": `Adjust`,
  "glossary.21.description": `Adjust is a feature to increase position value whilst the leveraged yield farming position is opened. Position value can be increased through adding collateral or borrowing more. In order to make the position sustainable, user has to consider the debt ratio. If the debt ratio is rather high, user should add collateral to lower the debt ratio and further prevent the position from getting liquidated. In opposite cases, with considerably low debt ratio, use could borrow more to increase the position value and seek for higher profit.`,
  "glossary.22.title": `Liquidation`,
  "glossary.22.description": `Liquidation is having a farming position automatically closed, withdrawing all asset when the condition is met. The condition is when user's leveraged yield farming position's debt ratio meets the liquidation threshold. In such condition user's borrowed asset is believed to be at risk and the user may not be able to repay the debt. `,
  "glossary.23.title": `Entirely Close`,
  "glossary.23.description": `Entirely close is withdrawing all the asset user put in leveraged yield farming position. With entirely close user will return the borrowed asset, pay the borrowing interest and take what's left. In the process of returning the borrowed asset, there may be token swap taking place causing loss coming from price impact. `,
  "glossary.24.title": `Partially Close`,
  "glossary.24.description": `Partial close is partially withdrawing asset in leveraged yield farming position. User may choose which asset to withdraw and how much of the borrowed asset to use in debt repayment. With partial close, user may be able to reduce the size of the token swap taking place, reducing the loss coming from price impact. `,
  "glossary.25.title": `Minimize Swap`,
  "glossary.25.description": `When withdrawing user may choose between 'minimize swap' or 'convert to debt token.' If user choose to 'minimize swap' then only the amount of token necessary in repaying debt is swapped. Thus swap size is minimized and so is the loss coming from price impact. `,
  "glossary.26.title": `Convert to Debt Token`,
  "glossary.26.description": `When withdrawing, user may choose between 'minimize swap' or 'convert to debt token.' If user choose to 'convert all to debt token' all token are withdrawn in debt token type. User will take what's left over after repaying debt. `,

  "glossary.1.description": `KLEVA Protocol에서 처음 거래하는 토큰의 경우, 토큰 사용을 승인하는 작업을 지갑에서 1회 거쳐야 합니다. 토큰 승인의 목적은 프로토콜이 유저 지갑에 접근권을 얻어 토큰에 대한 잔고를 파악하고 유저가 프로토콜 내에서 원하는 거래를 진행할 때 토큰을 지갑에서 프로토콜로 옮기기 위함입니다. 토큰 승인을 하는 과정에서 소량의 KLAY 가스비가 소요됩니다. `,
  "glossary.2.title": `토큰 스왑`,
  "glossary.2.description": `토큰 스왑은 토큰과 토큰 사이의 교환을 의미합니다. 해당 서비스를 이용해 유저는 지갑에 보유하고 있는 토큰을 이용해 필요한 토큰으로 교환할 수 있습니다. `,

  "glossary.4.title": `프라이스 임팩트`,
  "glossary.4.description": `프라이스 임팩트는 스왑의 규모가 커짐에 따라 토큰 교환비율에 주는 영향이 커져 발생하게 됩니다. 이에 따라 유저는 거래 체결 시점에 예상보다 적은 수량의 토큰을 수령하게 되어 손실을 보게 됩니다. <br/><br/>KLEVA Protocol 레버리지 투자에서는 두 토큰의 가치가 50:50으로 동일한 상태로 예치가 진행됩니다. 만일 유저가 예치한 두 토큰의 가치가 다를 경우, 스왑을 통해 맞추는 과정이 필요합니다. 이때 KLEVA Protocol은 가치가 더 높은 토큰을 활용해 더 낮은 토큰으로 스왑합니다. 이 과정에서 프라이스 임팩트가 발생할 수 있습니다.`,
  "glossary.5.title": `슬리피지`,
  "glossary.5.description": `슬리피지는 주문 과정에서 유저에게 안내된 토큰 가격과 실제 체결된 토큰 가격의 차이를 의미합니다. 이런 차이는 거래 체결 직전 외부 요인으로 토큰 교환비율이 변동된 경우에 발생합니다. 이에 따라 유저가 실제로 획득한 토큰 수량이 변동될 수 있습니다. <br/><br/>따라서 슬리피지로 인한 손실을 방지하기 위해 유저는 슬리피지 %를 설정할 수 있습니다. 예컨데 슬리피지 설정이 0.5%인 경우, 획득하는 토큰 수량이 예상치로부터 0.5% 이상 편차가 생기면 거래가 성사되지 않습니다.`,

  "glossary.11.title": `스테이킹`,
  "glossary.11.description": `스테이킹이란 보유한 토큰을 프로토콜에 맡기고, 맡긴 기간동안 보상을 얻는 것입니다. KLEVA Protocol 의 경우 토큰 예치의 증표로 받게되는 ibToken을 스테이킹해 KLEVA Token 보상을 기대할 수 있습니다.`,
  "glossary.12.title": `대여율`,
  "glossary.12.description": `대여율은 예치된 토큰이 레버리지 투자에 어느 정도로 활용되는 지를 보여주는 지표입니다. 토큰의 대여가 많이 발생해 대여율이 높아지면, 대여받은 자산의 이자가 상승해 결과적으로 예치 수익이 높아집니다. 추가로 '레버리지 투자 참여자'들의 대여받은 자산에 대한 이자비용은 대여율에 영향을 받습니다. 이에 대한 자세한 사항은 Docs > Triple Slope Model 에서 확인 가능합니다. `,
  "glossary.13.title": `ib 토큰`,
  "glossary.13.description": `ibToken (interest-bearing Token)은 이자가 쌓인다는 특징을 갖고 있는 토큰입니다. <br/><br/>KLEVA Protocol에 토큰을 예치하면, 예치 참여자는 예치의 증표로 ib토큰을 수령할 수 있습니다.이때 유저가 받게될 ib토큰 수량은 예치 당시의 환산 비율에 따라 결정됩니다. 예를 들어 환산 비율이 1 ibWEMIX = 1 WEMIX 라면, 100WEMIX를 예치해 100ibWEMIX를 수령할 수 있습니다. <br/><br/>예치된 토큰은 '레버리지 투자 참여자'들에게 대여하는데 사용됩니다. 이에 따라 '레버리지 투자 참여자'들이 지불한 이자는 ib토큰의 환산 비율을 상승시키는데 사용됩니다. 예를 들어, 1ibWEMIX= 1WEMIX에서 1ibWEMIX = 1.001WEMIX 로 상승해 ibWEMIX의 가치가 상승하게 됩니다. <br/>결과적으로 토큰 출금시, 예치 참여자들은 처음보다 많은 수량의 토큰을 지급받게 됩니다. 추가적으로 ib토큰을 스테이킹한 예치하기 참여자들은 KLEVA 토큰 보상을 받을 수 있습니다.   `,
  "glossary.14.title": `레버리지 투자`,
  "glossary.14.description": `'레버리지 투자'는 탈중앙화 거래소(DEX)에 토큰 쌍을 예치한 대가로 거래 수수료를 보상으로 분배받을 수 있는 서비스입니다. 보상의 원천은 해당 DEX에서 분배하는 거버넌스 토큰입니다. KLEVA Protocol에서는 레버리지 투자 참여자들에게 KLEVA 보상을 추가로 지급합니다.`,

  "glossary.17.description": `레버리지 자산에서의 총 운용 자산은 유저의 레버리지 투자 현황입니다. 자산의 달러 가치와 운용되고 있는 토큰 수량이 표기됩니다. <br/><br/>*총 운용 자산 = 담보자산 + 상환 필요 자산`,
  "glossary.18.title": `담보 자산`,
  "glossary.18.description": `담보자산은 레버리지 투자에 운용되고 있는 자산 중 유저 소유의 자산을 의미합니다. 이에 따라 담보자산에는 유저가 '레버리지 투자'에 투입한 토큰 수량과 '레버리지 투자' 과정에서 창출된 이자수익이 합산된 수치가 표기됩니다. `,
  "glossary.19.title": `상환 필요 자산`,
  "glossary.19.description": `상환 필요 자산은 유저가 '레버리지 투자'에 참여하면서 대여받은 자산과 이에 대해 발생한 이자 비용을 포함한 자산의 총량을 의미합니다. `,
